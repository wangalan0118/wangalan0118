Hi! Handsome brothers and beautiful sisters: I joined soon, please tell me where there is a problem or a more perfect place that can be improved. >.<a
Hope I can learn more here, and I found the people here are very friendly, unlike other places they don't guide me. QvQa
Thank you brother and sister. I am from Taiwan. If you have a chance, you can come to Taiwan and play with me! ^.^ Ya~

Since I don't have an account to sponsor the setting requirements, I have to post this to see if I can increase or decrease the subsidized tuition.
I also hope that big brothers and big sisters will forgive me, and I am very happy if I am not at all. The most important thing is to study in Kansai~
