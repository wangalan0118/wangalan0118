Hi! Dear brothers and sisters: 
I've been here for less than a month, please take care of me! 
If there is a wrong place or a more perfect way to present it >. < 
I hope to learn from each other, thank you ^. ^ 
Hope I can learn more here, and I find the people here are very friendly, unlike other places they don't guide me q. q 
Thank you, brothers and sisters, I am from Taiwan. If you have the opportunity to come to Taiwan to play, you can find me! ^. ^y 

Since I don't have a sponsorship system provided by the bank can charge sponsorship 
How much can I expect sponsorship to help with my study expenses
